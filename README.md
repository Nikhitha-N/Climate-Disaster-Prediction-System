Climate and Disaster Prediction Recommender System

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced recommender system that predicts climate temperature trends and assesses potential natural disasters based on the user-specified year and location (country). By leveraging historical data and predictive modeling, the system will provide valuable insights into environmental risks, enabling users to make informed decisions. This tool will be a crucial resource for climate analysis, disaster preparedness, and risk mitigation strategies.

🚀 Features

✔ Historical Temperature Trends – Retrieves and analyzes past temperature data.

✔ Natural Disaster Predictions – Assesses the likelihood of disasters based on past trends.

✔ CO₂ Emission Insights – Evaluates environmental impact and emissions correlation.

✔ Interactive Visualizations – Provides graphs and maps for easy interpretation.

✔ User-Specific Recommendations – Personalized predictions based on input year and location.
